* Find a path in maze by backtracking algorithm
** How to run this program
Clone it, and run 'make' in your terminal.
Then you will get a executable file named maze, run it in a terminal.
You will see a promote to input the row and col to generate you maze, your input decides the maze's size.
Then you can see the maze and one way to pass it.
Have Fun!
** How it runs
*** Generate a maze
This program uses the Union/Find Set to generate a maze, So the maze is always have one way to out.
*** Find a pass
I uses a backtrack method to traverse the maze, and then find a pass.
*** Other datastructure
I uses a Stack structure. Cause the C language has no library for stack, I implement it by myself. Which is the source file SeqStack.c
** Notes
The BFS source file didn't used at all. It just stay there by I want to write an another program through it. In this program, ignore it.
